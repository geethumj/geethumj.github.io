I am a Staff Research Scientist in Rakuten Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India, where I work on computer vision and machine learning. 

I joined Rakuten in May, 2019. At Rakuten, I mostly work on e-commerce applications. I did my PhD from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Sukhendu Das](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~sdas/). My thesis was on applications for shaky videos, such as video stabilization, moving object segmentation and panorama creation.
